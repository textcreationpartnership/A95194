            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT Nature is Subject to frequent miſcarriages is a thing not to be queſtioned. They that converſe with Hiſtory ſhall find Stories a now to confirm the truth of ſeveral ſtrange and Monſtrous. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, which make Men gaze and admire, but for which no certain reaſon can be given; neither are thoſe perſons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151419:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->who have thought it worth their while to record ſuch things, Men of little Fame, but Authors of the moſt ſolid Judgment and acuteſt Learning, among thoſe that have put pen to paper.</p>
            <p>True it is, that in regard Women, whoſe hap it is to be the firſt Diſcoverers, are generally the firſt Reporters; and ſuch ſort of Relations as theſe, are look't upon as the ſtories of Women given to divulge their own miſapprehenſions and affrightments; or elſe the fictions of Malitious Goſſips to diſgrace their Neighbours. But no ſuch Falſities as theſe are here obtruded upon the World, either for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement or for gain. However it is in ſome ſort neceſſary to ſatisfie the World in Stories of this Nature, which Fame will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes advance and multiply, as well to publick as to private pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. For the ſuperſtitious are apt to believe all Additions of report, and to apply their Imaginations to publick concernment, whereas in truth the Monſtroſity it ſelf may have been occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the-irregular fan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies of Conceiving and Breeding Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It has been a great happineſs to this Nation, that accidents of this Nature rarely fall out among us. But if Heaven at any time permit them, perhaps to puniſh the Pride and vanity incident to the Female Sex, and by the miſfortunes of one to admoniſh Multitudes, it is better to be warned by Truth, then multiplyed fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood. For it is not to be queſtioned but this Story has got into the World; and ſuch is the Nature of report, that when ſhe has got a Relation by the end, away ſhe flies with it, and at every Stage ſhe gathers new recruits, till ſhe has ſwell'd a Mole-hill to a Mountain.</p>
            <p>Having therefore a True Relation ſent me from the place it ſelf, and by an eye witneſs of the thing it ſelf, I though it but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to publiſh the Truth it ſelf to prevent fallacious miſtakes and abuſes of the world. And as for the deſcants that others ſhall make of it, I leave it to themſelves. Tho I am apt to believe that the beſt uſe which any perſons can make of this Relation, is to admire the ſecret Judgments of God, and to thank him that they themſelves were not the dreadful Examples of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>I have put down the Letter juſt as it came to me from a perſon of Repute and Integrity, and who as I ſaid before, was an Eye witneſs of the thing. And the Reader may well judge by the Stile, that it is no Elaborate Fiction or any thing of fram'd or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated invention. I ſhall ſay no more but give you the Letter it ſelf; leaving the more curious to be more amply convinc'd by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations eaſie to be obtained from a place ſo frequently Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withal as <hi>Exeter.</hi>

They in a ſhort time buried it, and it lay under Ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Tenth Inſtant, when it was taken up again; and its now expoſed to veiw, and there is dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting Hundreds of People to ſee it, which proves very advantageous to the Parents of the Child. An ingenuous Hand may eaſily draw a true Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Monſter, taking from this rude and bad Draught, the Places of the Heads and Faces, which is exact.</p>
